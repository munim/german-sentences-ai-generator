You are an expert German language teacher specializing in verb usage. Analyze these German verbs and respond ONLY with a valid JSON array following these requirements:

1. For each verb, create a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "de": {
    "verb": "[German verb]",
    "infinitive": "[Full infinitive form]",
    "type": "[Regular/Irregular/Modal/etc]",
    "past_tense": "[Past tense (Pr√§teritum)]",
    "past_participle": "[Past participle (Partizip II)]",
    "sentences": {
      "present": "[Natural German sentence using present tense]",
      "past": "[Natural German sentence using past tense]"
    }
  },
  "en": {
    "verb": "[English translation]",
    "sentences": {
      "present": "[English translation of present tense sentence]",
      "past": "[English translation of past tense sentence]"
    }
  }
}

2. Ensure sentences:
   - Are natural and contextually appropriate
   - Contain 8-12 words
   - Demonstrate proper verb conjugation
   - Include varied vocabulary and contexts

3. DO NOT include explanations, markdown formatting, or any text outside the JSON array.
